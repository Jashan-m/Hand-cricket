## Hand Cricket Game

This Python script implements a simple text-based hand cricket game. The game follows the basic rules of cricket with a twist of chance. It allows the player to choose between batting and bowling, and it simulates the opponent's moves using random numbers.

### Features:
- **Toss Mechanism:** Players choose between "ODD" or "EVEN" and select a number to determine the toss result.
- **Batting and Bowling:** Players can choose to bat or bowl based on the toss result. The game randomly generates the computer's response for each turn.
- **Score Tracking:** The game tracks and displays scores for both the player and the computer.
- **Game Result:** At the end of the game, it determines and displays whether the player won, lost, or if the game is a draw.

### How to Play:
1. Run the script.
2. Choose "ODD" or "EVEN" for the toss and pick a number between 1 and 10.
3. Based on the toss result, choose to bat or bowl.
4. Enter numbers for each turn when prompted.
5. The game will display scores and announce the winner or if it's a draw.
